# Voice Assistant Patterns

## Voice Interface Standards

### Component Structure
- Use Framer Motion for animations (`motion.div`, `motion.button`)
- Animated mic button with ripple effects when listening
- Real-time waveform visualization during voice input
- Status text showing "Listening..." or "Voice Assistant"

### Voice Command Examples
Users can say commands like:
- "Buy 0.5 ETH with 25% of my USDC"
- "Transfer 100 USDC to 0x1234..."
- "Sell 10% of my portfolio"
- "Show my portfolio balance"

### Implementation Approach
1. Frontend captures voice input via Web Speech API or ElevenLabs client
2. Sends audio/text to backend FastAPI endpoint
3. Backend processes through AI agent system
4. Returns transaction result
5. Frontend displays confirmation with TTS response

### State Management
- `isListening`: Boolean for mic active state
- `transcript`: String for captured voice text
- `transactions`: Array of transaction history
- `portfolio`: Current portfolio state

### Visual Feedback
- Animated microphone with pulsing ripple effect
- Color change: purple (idle) â†’ blue (active)
- Waveform bars during listening
- Status messages for user guidance
